1. How to start the React App:
	Step 1: Open CMD (Windows).
	Step 2: Create the folder of the app. we need call the directory of this folder in the CMD, use this command:
			cd [directory]; Example: cd C:\Users\Example\Documents\Proyects_Example.
	Step 3: When you are in the project folder we can create the project inside the folder with this command:
			npx create-react-app [name-react-app]
		if this is the first time you run this command on your pc, it will ask you to install the React packages, type yes and it will continue creating the app.
